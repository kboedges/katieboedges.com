I spend a lot of my free time learning about web development and practicing static trapeze. When I'm not doing one of those two things, I might be found at Austin's famous <span>uncommom OBJECTS</span> looking for antique photographs to add to my collection. I could also be sewing or cross-stitching...I have a lot of hobbies.</p>
